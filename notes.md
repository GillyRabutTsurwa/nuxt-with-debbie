NOTE: Once again, the file structure changed, mais l'id√©e c'est que l'on peut utiliser fetch partout. Il est flexible

fetch allows us to fetch (no pun intended) data at component level, on top of page level. AsyncData is page level only

We can fetch our MountainCards in any of our pages and it just works. Again, AsyncData is restricted to pages only.

we intergrated the fetch functionality in our MountainCards component. 

pree coo, not the coolest thing for me, but it's pretty neat. and it's javascript
